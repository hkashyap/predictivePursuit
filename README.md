# predictivePursuit
Code accompanying the IJCNN 2018 paper "A Recurrent Neural Network Based Model of Predictive Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement in Primates"

The code is tested using Matlab 2017a. If you use any part of this code in your research, please cite our IJCNN paper.

Files:

main_sp_predict.m (main script to run the prediction and the initiation experiemnts)

sp_predict_ramp_pertur.m (script to run the experiment with perturbation and phase shift)

get_accelaration.m (Calculates pursuit accelaration during initiation)

get_RS.m (plots retinal slip)

getWeights.m (RNN synapse weights)
